# Overview

  

This program is a C# re-creation of a previous Kotlin program I made called [Image_Saver](https://github.com/JaromPD/Image_Saver). The idea of the program is to create a simple list of Image objects that can be added, removed, and edited. The image objects contain an image name, date, and URL.

I wrote this program to help me learn C#. I have already learned C and C++ so I figured I might aswell take a shot at C# aswell!
